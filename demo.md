## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004. The primary goal of Markdown is readabilityâ€”the idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

Markdown has gained immense popularity over the years because of its simplicity and readability. It's widely used for writing README files, documentation, blog posts, forums, and even in chat applications.

### Why Use Markdown?

- **Readability**: Markdown's syntax is designed to be simple and intuitive.
- **Platform Independent**: You can use Markdown in a text editor, in a web editor, or as the formatting syntax for entire platforms.
- **Rich Output**: With simple syntax, you can produce rich text formatting.
- **Compatibility**: Many platforms automatically convert Markdown to HTML, making it easy to display rich text in a web browser.
- **Extensible**: While standard Markdown handles most common use cases, many platforms introduce their own extensions (called 'flavors') to add additional functionality like tables, code blocks, and more.

## Headers

```markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

## Emphasis

```markdown
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__
**_bold and italic_**
~~strikethrough~~
```
*italic* or _italic_

**bold** or __bold__

**_bold and italic_**

~~strikethrough~~

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

*Or using dashes:*

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b
```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

### Ordered Lists

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   2. Item 3b
```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   2. Item 3b

## Links

```markdown
[GitHub](http://github.com)
[GitHub with Title](http://github.com "GitHub")
```
[GitHub](http://github.com)

[GitHub with Title](http://github.com "GitHub")

## Images

```markdown
![GitHub-Mark-Light](/docs/images/github-mark-white.png#gh-dark-mode-only)
![GitHub-Mark-Dark](/docs/images/github-mark.png#gh-light-mode-only)
```
![GitHub-Mark-Light](/docs/images/github-mark-white.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

![GitHub-Mark-Dark](/docs/images/github-mark.png#gh-light-mode-only)

*Add #gh-light-mode-only or #gh-dark-mode-only to the end of the image link to make it only visible in light or dark mode, respectively.*

## Code:

### Inline code:

```markdown
Here is `inline code`.
```
Here is `inline code`.

### Block code without syntax highlighting:

```markdown
```This is a block of code.```
```
```
This is a block of code.
```

### Block code with syntax highlighting:

```markdown
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

## Tables

```markdown
| Header One     | Header Two     |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Content Cell 1 | Content Cell 2 |
| Content Cell 3 | Content Cell 4 |
```
| Header One     | Header Two     |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Content Cell 1 | Content Cell 2 |
| Content Cell 3 | Content Cell 4 |

## Horizontal Rules

Use three or more dashes, asterisks, or underscores:

```markdown
---
***
___
```
---
***
___

## Blockquotes

``` markdown
> This is a blockquote.
>
> > This is a nested blockquote.
```
> This is a blockquote.
>
> > This is a nested blockquote.

## Inline HTML

```html
<span style="color:red">This is red text.</span>
<div align="center">Centered Text</div>
```
<span style="color:red">This is red text.</span>
<div align="center">Centered Text</div>

## Escaping Characters

Backslash escapes Markdown characters:

```markdown
\*Not italic\*
\# Not a header
```
\*Not italic\*

\# Not a header

## Task Lists

In GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can create task lists:

```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
```
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task

## Footnotes

Some Markdown processors allow you to use footnotes, like so:

```markdown
Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]
[^1]: This is the footnote.
```
Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.

## Definition Lists

Not universally supported, but useful where available:

```markdown
Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in the family Rosaceae.
Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
```
Apple

:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in the family Rosaceae.

Orange

:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

## Automatic URL Linking

Most Markdown processors will automatically turn URLs into links:

```markdown
http://www.example.com
```
http://www.example.com

## Emojis

On platforms that support it (like GitHub), you can use shorthand for emojis:

```markdown
:smile: :+1:
```
:smile: :+1:

## Math Equations

Some Markdown renderers like the one used by Jupyter Notebook support `LaTeX` for rendering math equations:

```markdown
```math
E = mc^2
```

```math
E = mc^2
```

## Abbreviations

Some extended Markdown processors allow abbreviations:

```markdown
*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
*[W3C]:  World Wide Web Consortium
```
*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language

*[W3C]:  World Wide Web Consortium

## Citations

Certain academic Markdown variants allow citations in `BibTeX` format:

```markdown
According to Smith [@smith04], blah blah...
[@smith04]: John Smith. 2004. The Book Title. Publisher Name.
```
According to Smith [@smith04], blah blah...

[@smith04]: John Smith. 2004. The Book Title. Publisher Name.

## GitHub Flavored Markdown

### Alerts

GitHub Flavored Markdown supports alerts that can be used to highlight important information:

```markdown
  > [!NOTE]
  > Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

  > [!TIP]
  > Optional information to help a user be more successful.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

  > [!WARNING]
  > Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

  > [!CAUTION]
  > Negative potential consequences of an action.
```

## Closing

Remember, not all of these features are supported in every Markdown processor. Always check your specific processor's documentation for supported features.

You can use this as a README for your repository. Feel free to expand and improve the guide to better fit your requirements or to add more advanced features. Also, feel free to contribute and expand this guide for better community knowledge.
